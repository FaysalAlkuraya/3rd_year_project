  - accept partial matches when joining
  - de-duplicate projected datasets by symlinks
  - only train using unique entries from datasets
* major changes to solver, including Bayesian optimization
  - add partial grid support via "-P"
  - learn complex objectives not supported by Z3 by pre-evaluating
  - add support for whole-dataset derived information (such as time windows)
  - support zero radius meaning equality on any type
  - add support for BO to find candidates and counter-examples
* tooling
  - SMLP libs/executables movable by leveraging rpath relative to exec
  - restrict C to valid C++ subset
* deps
  - support seaborn-0.11.x
