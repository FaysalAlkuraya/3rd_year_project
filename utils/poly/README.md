# smlp

smlp is a program to solve and optimize polynomials and NNs over integers and reals.

## Usage

```
usage: smlp [-OPTS] [--] { DOMAIN EXPR | H5-NN SPEC GEN IO-BOUNDS } OP [CNST]

Options [defaults]:
  -1           use single objective from GEN instead of all H5-NN outputs [no]
  -a ALPHA     additional ALPHA constraints restricting candidates *and*
               counter-examples (only points in regions satsifying ALPHA
               are considered counter-examples to safety) [true]
  -b BETA      additional BETA constraints restricting only candidates
               (all points in safe regions satisfy BETA) [true]
  -c           clamp inputs (only meaningful for NNs) [no]
  -C COMPAT    use a compatibility layer, can be given multiple times; supported
               values for COMPAT:
               - python: reinterpret floating point constants as python would
                         print them
  -d DELTA     increase radius around counter-examples by factor (1+DELTA) [0]
  -F IFORMAT   determines the format of the EXPR file; can be one of: 'infix',
               'prefix' [infix]
  -h           displays this help message
  -n           dry run, do not solve the problem [no]
  -O OUT-BNDS  scale output according to min-max output bounds (.csv, only
               meaningful for NNs) [none]
  -p           dump the expression in Polish notation to stdout [no]
  -P PREC      maximum precision to obtain the optimization result for [0.05]
  -Q QUERY     answer a query about the problem; supported QUERY:
               - vars: list all variables
  -r           re-cast bounded integer variables as reals with equality
               constraints
  -R LO,HI     optimize threshold in the interval [LO,HI] [0,1]
  -s           dump the problem in SMT-LIB2 format to stdout [no]
  -t TIMEOUT   set the solver timeout in seconds, 0 to disable [0]

The DOMAIN is a text file containing the bounds for all variables in the
form 'NAME -- RANGE' where NAME is the name of the variable and RANGE is either
an interval of the form '[a,b]' or a list of specific values '{a,b,c,d,...}'.
Empty lines are skipped.

The EXPR file contains a polynomial expression in the variables specified by the
DOMAIN-FILE. The format is either an infix notation or the prefix notation also
known as Polish notation. The expected format can be specified through the -F
switch.

The problem to be solved is specified by the two parameters OP CNST where OP is
one of '<=', '<', '>=', '>', '==' and '!='. Remember quoting the OP on the shell
to avoid unwanted redirections. CNST is a rational constant in the same format
as those in the EXPR-FILE (if any).

```

Assuming files `domain` and `expression` are in the current directory, this would
be a sample to execute poly:

	$ build/src/smlp domain expression '>=' 0.42

## Build instructions

To build the program, meson <https://mesonbuild.com> is required.
Run:

	$ mkdir build && meson setup build && meson compile -C build

The resulting binary will be located in `build/src/smlp`.

A compiler supporting C++20 is required as well as:

- the kay library <https://github.com/fbrausse/kay>

  Use the parameter `-Dkay-prefix=PATH` for the `meson setup` command to
  specify the location of the kay library.
- GMP <https://gmplib.org> and either
  - its C++ bindings called `gmpxx`, or
  - Flint <http://flintlib.org>

    Use `-Dflint-prefix=PATH` for the `meson setup` command to specify a
    non-standard location of the flint library.

  Use one of `-Dflint=(enabled|disabled|auto)` to prefer Flint over `gmpxx`.
  The default is `auto`.
- Z3 and its C++ bindings <https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3>

### NN support

The usage output shown above is for a build that includes NN-support. This
requires more dependencies:

- kjson <https://github.com/fbrausse/kjson>
- hdf5 and its C++ bindings <https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5>
- sources of libiv (*not published, yet*)
