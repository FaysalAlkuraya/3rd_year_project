# poly

poly is a program to solve polynomial inequalities over the reals.

## Usage

```
usage: ./poly [-OPTS] [--] DOMAIN-FILE EXPR-FILE OP CNST

Options [defaults]:
  -C COMPAT   use a compatibility layer, can be given multiple times; supported
              values for COMPAT:
              - python: reinterpret floating point constants as python would
                        print them
  -F IFORMAT  determines the format of the EXPR-FILE; can be one of: 'infix',
              'prefix' [infix]
  -h          displays this help message
  -n          dry run, do not solve the problem [no]
  -p          dump the expression in Polish notation to stdout [no]
  -s          dump the problem in SMT-LIB2 format to stdout [no]
  -t TIMEOUT  set the solver timeout in seconds, 0 to disable [0]

The DOMAIN-FILE is a text file containing the bounds for all variables in the
form 'NAME -- RANGE' where NAME is the name of the variable and RANGE is either
an interval of the form '[a,b]' or a list of specific values '{a,b,c,d,...}'.
Empty lines are skipped.

The EXPR-FILE contains a polynomial expression in the variables specified by the
DOMAIN-FILE. The format is either an infix notation or the prefix notation also
known as Polish notation. The expected format can be specified through the -F
switch.

The problem to be solved is specified by the two parameters OP CNST where OP is
one of '<=', '<', '>=', '>', '==' and '!='. Remember quoting the OP on the shell
to avoid unwanted redirections. CNST is a rational constant in the same format
as those in the EXPR-FILE (if any).

## Build instructions

To build the program, meson <https://mesonbuild.com> is required.
Run:

	$ mkdir build && meson setup build && meson compile -C build

The resulting binary will be located in build/src/poly.

A compiler supporting C++20 is required as well as:

- the kay library <https://github.com/fbrausse/kay>
- GMP <https://gmplib.org> and either
  - its C++ bindings, or
  - Flint <http://flintlib.org>
- Z3 and its C++ bindings <https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3>
